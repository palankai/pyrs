Contribution
============

There are severe ways how can you help to make this work better. I welcome
any kind of contribution. Please read the following chapters about how can
you raise an issue, ask a new feature or actively improve the code.

Reporting a bug
---------------

You can report bugs or request any new feature on the 
`official issue tracking <https://github.com/palankai/pyrs-swagger/issues>`_
of this project.

If you open an issue please give me detailed information about the bug.
First of all I need to know which environment where you are using it.
The most important think what I have to know which version what are you use.
If it's the master branch, please mention the commit hash.
Second important think is the python version.
Please describe how can I reproduce, give me a small example or a
`gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_.
If you can attach traceback would be really appreciated.
Would help if you send me the ``pip freeze`` output and maybe the operating
system (I hope the different OS cannot cause any problem).

Milestones
^^^^^^^^^^

Please select the milestone when you open an issue related to your version the 
code. If you couldn't find that version (for example you are using 0.3.1
then you can find only 0.4, 0.5, 1.0) means that version is not supported.
In that case I suppose you should test it against the recent version and
report it then if it's still an issue.

I'm planning to fix any real reported issue.

If you would like to open a feature request, please leave empty the milestone.
I'll will decide which version would contain this improvement.

Keep in mind, this project has it's goals. I'm working on this project
just in my spare time, so I cannot promise any work on any feature request.

Issue labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^

I use almost the basic given configuration of github. Please follow that way.
The bug should be marked as bug. A feature request should be enhancement.

Create pull request
-------------------

I hope soon somebody help me to reach the project goals. If you would like to
help me work on this project, please contact me first, we should agree about
the planned work and how we should work together.
I'll review any pull request, though.

Any kind pull request, improvement should follow the coding standard of this
framework. I plan to reach the %100 test coverage against the whole project.
I'm using PEP8 validation against the whole code.
Just tested and PEP8 conform code can be released.

Please see the :doc:`codestyle` documentation.
